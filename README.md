# üìù Java File I/O Notes App

A comprehensive console-based notes management application built in Java with file persistence using I/O operations.

## üåü Features

### Core Functionality
- **Add Notes**: Create notes with title, category, and multi-line content
- **View Notes**: Display all notes or filter by category
- **Search**: Find notes by searching in title, content, or category
- **Edit Notes**: Modify existing notes (title, content, category)
- **Delete Notes**: Remove unwanted notes with confirmation
- **Auto-Save**: All changes automatically saved to file

### File I/O Operations
- **Persistent Storage**: Notes saved to `notes.txt` file
- **Backup System**: Create and restore backups (`notes_backup.txt`)
- **Export Function**: Export notes to readable text format
- **File Statistics**: View file information and storage details
- **Error Handling**: Robust file operation error management

### Advanced Features

## üöÄ How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Command line access

### Compilation
```bash
javac *.java
```

### Execution
```bash
java NotesApp
```

## üìã Usage Guide

### Main Menu Options
1. **Add New Note**: Create a new note with title, category, and content
2. **View All Notes**: Display all stored notes with details
3. **Search Notes**: Find notes using keywords
4. **View by Category**: Organize and view notes by categories
5. **Edit Note**: Modify existing note properties
6. **Delete Note**: Remove notes with confirmation
7. **Export Notes**: Save notes to external file
8. **Show Statistics**: View detailed statistics
9. **Backup Operations**: Create/restore backups
10. **Help**: Display detailed help information

### Adding Notes
1. Enter a descriptive title
2. Specify a category (optional, defaults to "General")
3. Type your note content
4. Type `END` on a new line to finish

### File Structure
- `notes.txt`: Main storage file (auto-created)
- `notes_backup.txt`: Backup file
- `exported_notes.txt`: Export files (custom names)

## üîß Technical Details

### File Format
Notes are stored in a pipe-delimited format:
```
Title|Content|Category|CreatedDateTime|ModifiedDateTime
```

### Error Handling
- File I/O exceptions are caught and handled gracefully
- Invalid input validation with user feedback
- Backup/restore operations with confirmation prompts
- Robust parsing of stored note data

### Features Demonstrated

#### File I/O Operations
- **FileWriter/FileReader**: Basic file writing and reading
- **BufferedReader**: Efficient line-by-line reading
- **PrintWriter**: Formatted text output
- **FileInputStream/FileOutputStream**: Binary file operations for backup

#### Java Concepts
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Proper class separation and encapsulation
- **Exception Handling**: Try-catch blocks for file operations
- **Collections**: ArrayList for note storage and management
- **Streams API**: Filtering and processing note collections
- **Date/Time API**: LocalDateTime for timestamps
- **String Manipulation**: Text processing and formatting

## üéØ Learning Objectives

This application demonstrates:
- File I/O operations in Java
- Object-oriented programming principles
- Exception handling best practices
- User interface design for console applications
- Data persistence and management
